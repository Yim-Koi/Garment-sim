# Garment factory simulation
This project was completed in colaboration with Megan Grannan.

For this project, we both learned to use Simpy to create a discrete event simulation of a hypothetical garment factory. 

We collaborated over Google Colab and the ipynb file contains the code and simulated statistics.

The pdf file contains the full report and tutorial for a quick start with Simpy
